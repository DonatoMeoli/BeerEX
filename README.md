*"Beer is proof that God loves us and want us to be happy."* (Benjamin Franklin)

BeerEX is a Telegram bot which embeds a [CLIPS Expert System](http://www.clipsrules.net/) that suggests a beer to drink 
with a meal. This code was developed during the Knowledge Engineering course @ 
[Department of Computer Science](http://www.uniba.it/ricerca/dipartimenti/informatica) 
@ [University of Bari "Aldo Moro"](http://www.uniba.it/).

[CraftBeer](https://www.craftbeer.com), published by the [Brewers Association (BA)](https://www.brewersassociation.org/),
helps with the filling of the beers database and system knowledge through the information contained into the
[Beer Styles Study Guide](https://www.craftbeer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/craftbeerdotcom-beer-styles.pdf) and 
[Beer & Food Course](http://www.craftbeer.com/wp-content/uploads/CB_Food_Course/BeerAndFoodCourse.pdf) material.
